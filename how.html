            <h1>How Fafa Works</h1>
            
            <h2>An Example of Collaborative Ownership</h2>
            <p><a href="john-muncie-fa.html">John Muncie</a> visits the <a href="casa-dellalba-fa.html">Casa Dell'Alba</a> in Catania. He sees, on the wall hanging above the entrance, a painting called CAV DANCING, likes the simplicity, and wants to buy it. This painting is by the "Transpersonal Making Team" - a collaborative painting team in residence at the Casa Dell'Alba.</p>
            
            <p>John gets in touch with <a href="job-profile.html">Job</a>, the TMT Sales Representative. Job explains that John can purchase 80 out of the 100 shares of that painting for 300 dollars. Job walks through John what will happen â€“ and here's what happens:</p>
            
            <p>First, John will get the painting, along with instructions for care: keep it out of direct sunlight, as there are materials in it which may age over the time.</p>
            
            <p>A collector in Brussels sees the painting in the TMT gallery, and makes an offer (through Job again) to buy seventy shares in the painting for 1000. John's 80 shares entitle him to 80 percent of the return: he gets 800. The remainder is split between TMT, who has 12 shares and Fafa, 8 shares. John retains ten per cent of the shares.</p>
            
            <p>Next year, Pat, the exhibitions director for TMT gets in touch with Pierre, the brussels collection. A show in Ho Chi Minh City wants to exhibit the painting. Could they show it? Pierre reluctantly agrees: he loves the work, but senses an opportunity for profit.</p>
            
            <p>Pierre is correct. In Ho Chi Minh, a collector loves the work and buys it for 200 million vietnamese dong, about 8000 dollars. Pierre in Brussels gets 5600, TMT gets 960, John gets 800, Fafa gets 640.</p>
            
            <h2>Provenant Inventory</h2>
            <p>This example focused on collaborative ownership, but provenant inventory is involved, too. In exchange for that eight percent, FAFA stored, transported, and kept track of the location of the painting. This record allows artist, collector, curators to know the provenance of these artworks.</p>
            
            <h2>Beyond Paintings</h2>
            <p>Fafa isn't just for collaborative painting. There are Fa's for books (like <a href="tank-think-fa.html">Tank Think</a>), for institutional spectacles (like <a href="performance-office-fa.html">Performance Office</a>), for media studios (<a href="nc30pix-fa.html">NC30.pix</a>) and even for fafa itself (<a href="fafa-fund-fa.html">Fafa Fund FA</a>).</p>
